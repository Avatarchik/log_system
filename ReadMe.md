This is a project use dlib and OpenCV to implement a log system.

You need to install OpenCV firstly.
dlib.19.16 has been in the folder.

build your log system by
```bash
cd log_system
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
then run ./log_test
follow the indication

you can use pictures in the faces folder to test.

Code is based on dlib example `dnn_face_recognition_ex`. Save data and read data to XML file by OpenCV's FileStorage.
Code is easy to understand, at least I think so.
